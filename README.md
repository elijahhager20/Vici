# Vici

Vici, the one and only worst version control system known to man.
## Questions

#### Who is it made/designed for?

Myself.

#### What language is it written in?

English.

#### Why did you choose this project to create?

I was bored, and I figured that the best way to spend my time was to create a copy of Git.

#### Why C++?

I like the filesystem and fstream headers. And it was good practice for Object Oriented Programming.
## Use

You must add the folder containing viciw.exe and vici.bat to your PATH variables.

Don't expect this to be a perfect project, because it isn't. It's a 13 year old trying his hardest.
